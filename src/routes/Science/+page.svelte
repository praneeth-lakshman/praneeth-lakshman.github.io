			This website aims to document my steps into becoming a more informed individual. You will see
			two different voices in all my blogs, as I try to accurately depict the process in my mind
			whilst learning. I aim for this website to shine light on ideas that have not previously been
			given a second thought; to explore the meaning behind things we take for granted; and to make
			sure that, by the end of each article, you can come away feeling like you have learnt
			something. Thank you for your time and support.
